 DECOVID CHARITY

The world is getting funtional again, People are moving ahead at the expence of affecting the society cataclysmically and making people more stanniofish and aloof.
still out there exists 30,000+ covid positive cases per day in india, Some prople are becoming too competitive to earn money ,
while some of the sufferers of  corona virus  have no clue how about getting even a penny
,but at the same time there exist people ,who wish to contribute ,But the existing centralised system and brokers for charity are so currupt
that people lose belief in these trustless system and hence these charities become futile.
What if we can use the rapacious ideology of money minded people 
coupled with the modern technology to make the charity system more effective and trustful .

using blockChain : We are using a decentralised distributed system to buils the platform where all information will be kept on
the public distributed network of blockchain,This could be done using smart contract which is also a part of blockchian,so the ledger will contain 
both the transaction and the contributers information, the system we are proposing is based on ethereum network,hence "ether" will be 
used as crypto-currency for exchange, the smart contracct is written in ethereum platform using solidity which runs over ethereum
virtual machhine
 
Decentralisation: This platform is free of all central institution and intermediateries that will reduce the transaction fees,and moreover 
that bring effectiveness and trust to this platform

security: This platfrom will allow every hospital to commute and register directly, but still the developer will validify the hospital 
by analysing details provided ,then only alowed to be funded.

Type of users: There are basicaly three types of users who are involved in this distributed blockchain based platform: Developer,Contributer,
Hospitals,the role of developer is to validify hospitals .

Transparency: Here users will not have to pay a penny for their registration, all they have to is contribute.
users can check all details of hospitals and afterwards they can contribute whatever amount they want ,there is no minimum contribution
and then they can see their address and details in that hospital's contributers list.
This iskind of book keeping dataset which will be transparent ,distributed and shared all over the network.

Fund security: All the donation amount are present in contract account of that respective hospitals,and that can be only withdrawn by the 
registered manager of the hospital and even that can only transfer to manager's account.

Fund Request: This is added feature in our platform , that any valid hospital can send fund request to another valid hospitals,
which can be only procedded with the permission of receiver hospital's manager.

conlcusion: This is a system for using cryptocurrency for charity work for covid positive paitients, to make it more transparent
,trustful we use blockchain technology
